# Airgead_Banking_App

The Airgead Banking App was a project for Southern New Hampshire University's CS-210 course developed to request an initial deposit, recurring monthly deposit, APR %, and length of time - then output the monthly end balance to the user. 

Moving forward I would like to improve the user experience by incorporating a Graphical User Interface, add a total for the end of the given time, and give the user the ability to change the monthly deposit per month or withdraw funds to see the overall effects each decision makes to their portfolio. 

For me, the most challenging portion of this code was creating a clean interface during the output presented to the user, and how to store the data appropriately. Viewing tutorials online and reading the material within the course assisted me in overcoming this issue.

The code was created in a maintainable, readable, and adaptable way by providing the separate classes in their own files and ensuring whitespace and comments were added appropriately.
